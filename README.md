# PF2e-Foundry-Data-Entry
A script to aid with data entry for the PF2e system for Foundry VTT

To run it you must either use the binder link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TikaelSol/PF2e-Foundry-Data-Entry/HEAD) or download the repository and run it using Jupyter.

Run the code in each cell by either clicking the run button, choosing run all from the cell menu, or using shift enter.  Then once the function definition has been run the function call cell should ask for an input, pasting in the text to be formatted and hitting enter will copy the result to your clipboard (this automatic copy may not work on all OS / browsers)

To run it a second time select the input cell and run it again (shift enter runs a cell quickly).
